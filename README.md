Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

# Description
This project was started as a way for a user to generate a simple logo or monogram with only a few input. This was able to be achived by using Inquirer in the command line. From there I was able to select a few questions for the user to respond to and take there response and create an SVG file. With that SVG file it allows the user to have an image that is not only scalebale in size, but is also customized to the color, shape and even with the characters of their choosing.

* Requires these be installed before initialization
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Inquirer Ver.8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)
* [Jest Ver.24.9.0](https://archive.jestjs.io/docs/en/24.x/getting-started.html) 

# Credits
Source code was taken from the "OSU-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC" repository. Lessons from module 10-OPP and 11-Express from the previously mentioned repository were used as a reference point for where to begin. 
Stack Overflow was used as a reference and to help when problems came up that needed trouble shooting("e.g" Inquirer not running a prompt with the latest update and needing to be set back to Ver.8)
